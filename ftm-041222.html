    Insights</h2>
  <ul class="jss70">
    <li class="jss71">Fantom launched during the ICO boom of 2018. The protocol was quiet for a few years as it built
      out its technology stack, before picking up momentum throughout 2021 and into 2022 as it focused on DeFi.</li>
    <li class="jss71">The project’s technology could fundamentally improve existing methods. Fantom attempts to solve
      the blockchain trilemma by utilizing a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure for its nodes which enables higher
      throughput for the protocol.</li>
    <li class="jss71">While TVL grew impressively in 2021 and early 2022, the departure of key contributor Andre Cronje
      coincided with a sharp drop in TVL and a daily new address. Developer activity and transaction volume have also
      declined.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Fundamental metrics like revenue, price to sales, and TVL to market cap remain strong relative to
      peers, but it remains to be seen if these metrics were driven in large part by Andre’s influence.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Even before Andre left, the spiking transaction costs during periods of high activity were a
      potential red flag to scaling the network.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Overall, the protocol has some great things going for it, but the ghost of Andre looms large,
      making it a speculative investment at this time.</li>

    Protocol and Team Overview</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom was
    created in 2018 by Ahn Byung Ik, a Ph.D. in computer science and founder with multiple prior exits. Little is
    mentioned about these early days on Fantom’s official channels, but there <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y810diAHsvQ" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">are indications</a> the
    project did not have the robust technology it initially pitched. Ik and the early team left the project entirely in
    2019. Fantom was quickly picked up by the well-regarded Andre Cronje and current CEO Michael Kong. Cronje is a
    serial DeFi founder with a strong reputation in the space. He built and helped drive popular protocols
    Yearn.Finance, Keep3r Network, and Multichain.xyz to billions of dollars in value locked, almost overnight. Cronje
    helped spearhead the technical aspects of Fantom in its early days and helped launch many popular Fantom apps before
    apparently departing crypto entirely in March 2022. Anton Nell, Andre’s partner, and another major technical
    contributor, also decided to step aside. Today, Fantom is led by Kong at the helm of the Fantom Foundation.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The early goal
    of the protocol was to be the backbone of smart cities but has since pivoted to focus more on DeFi. Today, Fantom
    boasts one of the most used DeFi platforms among all Layer-1s.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"></p>

    Technology</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom is a
    Proof-of-Stake Layer-1 smart contract platform competing directly with Ethereum, Solana, Avalanche, and others.
    Fantom calls their ecosystem Opera. The core architecture of the Fantom Opera ecosystem is made up of two main
    layers: the Ware layer and the Consensus (core) layer.</p>
  <h3 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss68 MuiTypography-h3 css-qubbtm e1de0imv0" id="a6aa5be8c862-consensus-layer">
    Consensus Layer</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom
    attempts to solve the blockchain trilemma by utilizing a <a class="jss73 jss75"
      href="/article/directed-acyclic-graph-dag">directed acyclic graph (DAG)</a> structure for its nodes. DAGs are
    well-known database structures for transmitting data throughout a network. They are characterized by a web of nodes
    rather than a chain. This structure increases throughput because transactions don’t need to be serialized like they
    do in a traditional blockchain.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Each Fantom
    node stores a local DAG composed of events blocks containing lists of transactions. As transactions are confirmed on
    an individual node, they are periodically shared with other nodes. Once transactions are confirmed by enough
    independent nodes, blocks are batched to form the finalized blockchain This structure allows Fantom nodes to process
    transactions faster and more efficiently than data structures on other chains. For data availability, DAGs are
    separated into sub-DAGs called epochs which are composed of finalized batches of transactions.</p><img

      Whitepaper 2.0</a>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The DAG
    structure is the underlying technology of a novel consensus mechanism called Lachesis. Lachesis is based on the
    principles of asynchronous Byzantine fault technology (aBFT). Traditional BFT networks require nodes to constantly
    communicate as they send each other blocks for validation. This type of communication becomes an issue as the
    network scales. Lachesis does not suffer from the same constraint.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Lachesis is
    asynchronous, meaning nodes can independently reach consensus. They then periodically exchange transactions to agree
    on what has recently happened on the network. There is no mempool. Nodes don’t have to wait for other nodes to reach
    consensus. Transactions can be confirmed as soon as they enter the network. To explain Lachesis, Fantom’s CEO King
    likes to use a train analogy. For Bitcoin, trains come every ten minutes, and you have to hope there is space for
    you when that train comes along. With Fantom, trains are always waiting and never full, and you can access them on
    demand.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">In a DAG, all
    users are both issuers (i.e., they make/send transactions) and validators. This structure allows consensus to also
    be leaderless: there is no one validator who has to propose a block. The entire network doesn’t have to agree on one
    specific block at one time. There is a network of “primary” nodes confirming transactions while secondary or
    monitoring nodes, serve as a second checkpoint. Misbehaving actors forfeit 100% of their staked FTM. This is a huge
    disincentive as the minimum stake is currently over a half-million dollars.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The consensus
    is deterministic versus probabilistic. In Bitcoin or other blockchains, the longest chain determines what is
    canonical. After a certain series of blocks, usually 10–60 minutes worth depending on the blockchain, we can
    determine that it is very unlikely that our transaction will be reverted. The transaction is considered final. Due
    to the enhancements we discussed, Lachesis allows for 1–2 second finality.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Overall, this
    novel technology stack has proven extremely reliable, avoiding any downtime and network issues even during times of
    extreme volume.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"></p>
  <h3 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss68 MuiTypography-h3 css-qubbtm e1de0imv0" id="f1fcec04f9ab-ware-layer">Ware
    Layer</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom’s Ware
    layer provides open-source APIs and smart contract functionality. The main codebase is written in Solidity, and
    applications are EVM-compatible. Fantom is developing its own Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM) to replace the EVM in the
    Ware layer. The FVM timeline has yet to be determined. Payments on the Ware layer for smart contract usage are made
    in the FTM token.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Leveraging the
    EVM, the Fantom mainnet was officially launched in late 2019. The ecosystem did not have much functionality in its
    early years, and as the technology grew the network finally hit an inflection point in 2021. Today, the Ware layer
    has flourished into a network with extensive smart contact activity. The majority of the activity is focused on
    DeFi. Apps focusing on gaming and NFTs are slowly springing up, but the majority remain in their infancy. Below is a
    visual of some of the key apps on the ecosystem. As you can see there are many of the Ethereum native primitives
    users know and love like Metamask, Curve, and Dai.</p><img

      href="https://geist.finance/markets" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">Geist Finance</a> is the most popular
    native lending platform on Fantom, similar to AAVE on other platforms. It contains roughly $500 million in TVL.
    Geist takes a unique approach to the banking model in rewarding borrowers. Lenders and borrowers receive 50% of
    protocol fees subject to a 3-month lockup (2:1 in favor of borrowers). The remaining 50% of protocol fees are
    distributed to Geist stakers. In the first year, 65% of all GEIST tokens in existence will be distributed as
    rewards. Geist’s token price has dropped from $3.70 at launch down to $0.11 at the time of writing mainly due to the
    inflationary nature of this reward structure. Another unique aspect of Geist is that it is completely decentralized:
    no governance and no venture capitalists. Scream is another similar platform on Fantom that is a direct competitor
    to Geist.</p><img

      href="https://solidly.exchange/" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">Solidly</a> is a new AMM, also based on
    Uniswap, introduced by Andre Cronje. The protocol initially received massive adoption in the Fantom ecosystem,
    bringing in $2 billion in TVL in less than a week before losing 80% of its TVL after Andre departed the project. The
    original goal was to improve upon the popular vote escrow (ve) token model pioneered by Curve. Curve is an AMM
    primarily focused on stablecoins. For providing liquidity to pools, users receive Curve tokens as well as a
    proportion of trading fees charged to users. These users are then incentivized to lock their Curve governance token
    for further rewards. They are awarded veCRV based on the length of time the Curve government tokens are locked up,
    thereby giving them more governance power over the protocol. This is great for users in that they get more rewards,
    great for the protocol because it encourages users to lock up funds there, but not great for users' liquidity as
    rewards are locked.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">On Solidly,
    the locking mechanism is similar to Curve in that users can lock tokens for 1, 2, 3, or 4 years and receive a
    commensurate reward the longer they lock their tokens, but the rewards they receive are distributed in an NFT which
    is freely tradable. Solidly also makes some other novel improvements on the Curve model to further incentivize
    ecosystem participants, the most notable one centered around token voting rights. Solely focuses on incentivizing
    what the protocol ultimately cares about (fee income) rather than pool size.</p>

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom has
    partnered with numerous nation-states to use its technology. Tajikistan to power government information, Ukraine for
    intellectual property exchanges, Pakistan for education, and Uzbekistan on a CBDC and supply-chain use cases. This
    use case for their technology is fairly novel among Layer-1s as nation-state adoption is generally lacking. Many of

    Tokenomics</h2>
  <h3 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss68 MuiTypography-h3 css-qubbtm e1de0imv0" id="28291f1cfadd-usage">Usage</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom uses
    FTM as its native token. FTM’s uses include as a governance token, network security mechanism via staking, and
    payment mechanism for transactions and fees. For network security, stakers are required to lock up 500,000 FTM and
    maintain industrial-grade hardware (AWS EC2 m5.xlarge with 4 vCPUs (3.1 GHz) and at least 1 TB of Amazon storage).
    Validator size is capped at 15x the self-stake amount. Stakers who meet these requirements and decide to run their
    own node can receive yields <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/fantom/metrics/" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">above 15%</a>.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Users with
    less FTM can delegate their stake. Stakers who delegate can lock up their token for up to a year to earn <a
      href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/fantom/metrics/" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">12–13%</a> or stake
    as they go for roughly 5%. Inflation averages <a href="https://www.stakingrewards.com/earn/fantom/" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">roughly 7% </a>per annum. Stakers earn 70% of all transaction fees paid by network users, with
    the remaining 30% being held in a special fee contract (SFC) controlled by governance. Fantom allows for
    reinvestment of staked assets keeping these assets fairly liquid. Staked FTM can be redeemed for sFTM or aFTMb which
    then can be used for yields farming, trading, lending, etc.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">As a
    governance token, one FTM equals one vote, with each governance proposal submission costing 100 FTM. FTM has the
    unique mechanism of ranked-choice voting for proposals which enables greater flexibility as compared to binary
    votes. A minimum level of agreement across voters is required for network changes, ranging from 55% for minor
    updates to 90% for major updates.</p><img

    investors, advisors, and insiders at 62% is higher than OG Layer-1s like Ethereum, Bitcoin, and Cardano (all under
    25%), but in line with newer Layer-1s like Solana, Avalanche, BSB, NEAR, ICP, and Polkadot (all above 50%).</p><img

    unlock period was heavily front-loaded with most unlocks completed by early 2020. The remaining distributions of the
    pre-mined tokens will be for inflation rewards. About 600,000 FTM are awarded to stakers per day until this supply
    runs out in 2024. At this point, the network must be mature enough for stakers to be rewarded through transaction
    fees alone or the reward structure must be adjusted — more on this in the section on risks.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">In August
    2021, a 370 million FTM developer incentive fund was announced to help to continue to drive developer growth. The
    program is fully programmatic, with no arbitrary approval process. Protocols are rewarded based on their
    time-weighted average TVL. Unfortunately, this has allowed the incentive rewards so far <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrLgRNsnYeM" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">to be gamed</a>. Still,
    only ~20 million of that FTM was distributed in 2021, leaving 350 million FTM or (over $500 million) for developer
    rewards in 2022 and beyond. We’ve seen these types of funds drive strong ecosystem growth for other major Layer-1s
    like NEAR ($800 million fund) and Avalanche (multiple $200+ million funds).</p>

    Competition</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom’s
    DAG-based model allows the protocol to be much faster and cheaper than most of the competition. They also have a
    time to finality that's one of the best in the business. Still, these advantages come with the trade-off of
    centralization. Running a Fantom node costs over $500,000 and requires some serious hardware, and as a result, there
    are fewer than 100 nodes currently operating. We’ll look to see if Fantom can maintain the technical advantages as
    they scale while increasing the number of validators on the network. Right now most of their metrics compare
    favorably to the much more popular Solana and Avalanche.</p><img

    Future Roadmap</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Standalone EVM:</strong> Fantom is doing research to build an eventual replacement to EVM within their
    ecosystem. The EVM is a stack-based VM that has to process transactions in order rather than in parallel. This
    creates numerous bottlenecks as well as storage issues. Fantom is building a new register-based virtual machine to
    improve throughput at the base layer. The end product will be an entirely new virtual machine, new compiler, and new
    interpreter that will enable higher transaction speed with lower data storage requirements. These improvements will
    allow faster smart contract execution than the EVM allows. The team claims that in testing the FVM is able to
    process 10x more transactions when compared to the EVM.
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Storage Updates: </strong>The size of the existing DAG is growing very quickly and will soon approach a size
    that could lead to onerous hardware requirements for smaller validators as they come online. Fantom plans to explore
    multiple storage solutions to meet this challenge. One solution is decentralized solutions to store the history of
    the blockchain by <a class="jss73 jss75" href="/asset/arweave/research">Arweave</a> and others. Fantom is also
    exploring flat storage data structures to allow nodes to more quickly access data.
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"><strong>More
      On-Ramps: </strong>Fantom is looking to <a
      href="https://fantom.foundation/blog/december-2021-ama-recap-with-ftm-alerts/" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">add more fiat to FTM gateways</a> over 2022 to allow for easier onboarding of users.
    Onboarding users remains a common pain point for ecosystems, particularly protocols not listed on major exchanges
    like Coinbase as is the case with Fantom.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Scalability Upgrades: </strong>Over the next few months network upgrade <a
      href="https://fantom.foundation/blog/upcoming-fantom-protocol-upgrades/" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">Snapsync</a> will be rolled out. Snapsync will allow the network to download blocks quicker,
    allowing network participants to download the full state of the network faster. The upgrade will reduce the overall
    state (2.7 TB to 270 GB). Further enhancements for storage and node structure will be coming as well, particularly
    surrounding the RPC nodes which will reduce memory consumption by 90% (from 90 mb/s to 7 mb/s).

  </h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">New addresses
    holding a token are generally tightly correlated to token price. The intuition is simple, the more new users that
    are interested in a protocol during a particular time period, the more value the native token accrues as those users
    onboard and utilize the ecosystem. This reflects the new incremental demand above the steady state of the current
    user base.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Historically,
    there has been a strong correlation of roughly 0.7 between FTM token price and new addresses obtaining FTM; a strong
    correlation. As seen in the chart below, new addresses have steadily ticked down since January. This fall began even
    prior to the departure of Cronje. New addresses stagnated and grew slightly with the launch of Solidly. This slide
    continued in March despite FTM price rebounding along with the broader crypto market. If the prior strong
    correlation between new accounts and token price continues to hold, Fantom should be trading closer to $1.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom has a
    fairly high transaction volume — it is by no means a ghost chain. But while daily transactions volume is mostly in
    line with major Layer-1s, it has come down from the start of March. Daily transactions peaked in September 2021 and
    have stayed in a constant range for the past six months despite broader network growth. The spike in February 2022
    can be attributed to the launch of Solidly. Network usage has stagnated since October while other chains have seen
    their transaction volume trend upwards over that time period: NEAR has seen 2-3x volume and Avalanche 3x-4x.</p><img

    developer additions were strong in 2021 as we discussed earlier, actual developer activity has been weak in 2022.
    Looking at the repositories and branches of a protocol to measure commit activity, Fantom ranks 35th among
    protocols. New commits to Fantom have notably declined since Andre left at the start of March.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">To contribute
    to the headwinds, the protocol has an usual monetary supply schedule. Over 400 million FTM will come into the
    ecosystem in the next year and a half or so in the form of staking rewards. This distribution of new supply should
    further dilute the overall value of the existing tokens. Inflation then completely subsides in 2024 as the pre-mined
    reward pool is extinguished, presenting a new issue for the protocol as to how to adequately reward stakers.</p>

    Case</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The bull case
    for FTM is driven by fundamentals. Looking at Fantom versus other Layer-1s paints the protocol in a very positive
    light. Fantom has more revenue than Solana at less than 1/10 the market cap. It also has a very attractive
    price-to-sales ratio, even compared to the reigning Ethereum.</p><img
    src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/fb2a484cf1540c69e0acc9d7886e058ca60bebbf-1222x653.jpg?w=800&amp;auto=format"

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">FTM is
    undervalued when looking at the TVL relative to market cap compared to the competition. They also generate more
    revenue per dollar of TVL. These are important metrics to gauge network usage and conflicts with some of the new
    address data we discussed in our bear case.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">FTM also could

    (ghost-themed), low token price, relatively low VC count, and focus on fair launches. It is not listed on major US
    exchange Coinbase which could provide a nice tailwind if and when it is added. Fantom also has plans to launch its

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Although
    Fantom claims to be very cheap, that isn't always the case, at least at the current juncture. Transaction spikes in
    January and February led to surges in gas prices. These were periods where the DeFi primitives Fantom is known for
    were being used the most. Gas fees peaked above $1, which is much lower than Ethereum but much higher than the
    average price of &lt;$0.01 the network usually has. The hope is that the SnapSync upgrade mentioned earlier will
    alleviate some network congestion and lower gas.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Indications

    original whitepaper for Fantom <a href="https://youtu.be/jrLgRNsnYeM?t=472" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">was
      likely plagiarized</a>. The original team left in a hurry after the technology was discovered to not be what the
    broader Fantom Foundation thought it was. Fantom missed out on a lot of ecosystem growth in 2019, and 2020 as they
    rearchitected their technology stack. The rough start for the project left a bad taste in many investors’ mouths. To
    be fair, the current FTM has been exceptionally forthright about this, discussing it at length in multiple
    interviews. Still there remains the possibility, however small, that the original founders could come back, have
    some residual claims, and cause some trouble.</p>

    validators, the high staking requirement must first be changed via governance. There is an outstanding governance

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Today
    validators are incentivized to secure the network through a combination of the inflation rewards from the initial
    pre-mine and the 70% cut of transaction fees. Once the pool of rewards expires in 2024, rewards paid to validators
    will drop dramatically. As a protocol that is popular because of its decentralized finance primitives, the velocity
    of money is key to power applications, and having no continuous supply of new tokens is a potential issue.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">There have
    been discussions on how to incentivize validators after the existing pool is extinguished. One proposal that has
    been discussed includes splitting fUSD liquidation fees with validators. Another is to have oracles pay validators
    to use certain price fees. A third is to implement an EIP-1559-type fee burn mechanism but, instead of burning
    rewards, to have some percentage go to validators. Although there have been numerous suggestions, there currently is
    no clear plan on what happens when validator rewards run out.</p>

    Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">After a rocky
    start, Fantom started to gain traction in late 2021 and into 2022, particularly in the DeFi world. The DAG-based
    blockchain technology is truly a unique approach to solving the blockchain trilemma. Fantom’s valuation metrics are
    cheap when compared with other major alt-L1s. TVL to market capitalization is the lowest of any major protocol.
    Revenue also remains higher than popular alternatives like Solana.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">But can Fantom
    sustain its momentum with Andre Cronje gone? TVL in their DeFi primitives has roughly been cut in half since the
    peak in early March. Much of the strong network and developer usage metrics dropped off after Andre left. It’s also
    tough to have any near-term conviction on price appreciation for the Fantom token with such a new disconnect between
    token price and new address growth. The end of inflation rewards in 2024 is a real cause for concern in
    incentivizing stakers to secure the network.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Fantom is a
