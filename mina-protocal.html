  <ul class="">
    <li class="jss71">Traditional blockchains are inefficient in storing their constantly growing data. This problem of
      state bloat negatively affects the network's decentralization as fewer users are able to participate in chain
      validation.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Mina Protocol is a new-gen layer-1 blockchain that addresses the problem of state bloat. Mina
      stays a fixed small size of ~11 kB with the power of zk-SNARKs. Beyond decentralization, zk-SNARKs also make Mina
      more private and efficient than other chains.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Other new-gen blockchains have optimized for scalability in the blockchain trilemma, compromising
      on decentralization in the process; Mina prioritizes decentralization first. Theoretically, any smartphone or
      browser can run a full node on Mina.</li>
    <li class="jss71">However, many of these groundbreaking features for Mina are still under development. The product
      roadmap is ambitious; the team's ability to deliver will decide the success of the protocol.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class=" ">According to the blockchain trilemma, improvements in any one of the three desirable goals of a
    blockchain – scalability, decentralization, and security – come at a cost to the other two. As blockchain technology
    has improved over the years, the latest generation of blockchains has had some success in overcoming the trilemma.
    They have focused on scalability, improving throughput by several orders of magnitude but have made various
    trade-offs to decentralization and security. Solana, for example, has &gt;1,000x transaction throughput of Ethereum
    but requires its validators to use <a href="https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-reqs"
      target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">industrial-grade hardware</a> and commit to consistently upgrading it. This
    impedes decentralization as the broader community is priced out from taking part in chain validation.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The older
    generation of blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum continue to suffer from low scalability because they
    prioritize decentralization. However, decentralization of even these blockchains is under pressure as their size now
    exceeds hundreds of gigabytes, thus raising the requirements to run a full node. The responsibility is then left to
    enthusiasts who can afford to spend significant resources towards the good cause of decentralization. In the blog
    post "<a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2021/05/23/scaling.html" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">The Limits to
      Blockchain Scalability</a>", Vitalik Buterin warns against significantly increasing a blockchain's parameters to
    meet the demand for block spaces because it could lead to "extreme centralization" if the average user is unable to
    run a node.</p><img

    Protocol</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina Protocol
    currently functions as a payment chain and completed the first anniversary of its mainnet launch on March 23, 2022.
    Smart contracts, called zkApps, are on the product roadmap for Q2 2022. Earlier this month, it raised $92 million
    from marquee crypto investors such as Three Arrows Capital and FTX Ventures to execute its vision of building a
    private and secure layer for web3.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">While other
    recent layer-1s have maximized scalability, Mina Protocol has chosen to maximize decentralization. As a succinct
    blockchain, Mina uses recursive cryptography to keep a verifiable version of the blockchain restricted to a fixed
    size of about 11kB, versus petabytes for a layer-1 like Solana. Unlike other layer-1 blockchains that grow with
    every block added, Mina is able to stay a fixed size by using a self-referencing series of cryptographic proofs. It
    is helpful to think of Mina’s recursive cryptography process as taking a photograph of the blockchain. Whenever a
    new block is added, another photo is taken of the new block with the existing blockchain, limiting the size of the
    blockchain to just one picture while keeping all the information from genesis.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">With that
    introduction, this report goes deeper into the problem of state bloat plaguing traditional blockchains and how Mina
    uses zero-knowledge proofs to address it and, in the process, provides a more private, decentralized, and efficient
    blockchain. It explores how Mina's design choices and key players enable it to work as a succinct blockchain with
    support from its native token, MINA. Finally, the report discusses what is yet to come for Mina, its product
    roadmap, and the team that is building towards achieving its lofty vision.</p>

  <blockquote class="jss78">“The blockchain and state bloat would ever increase the cost of syncing up full nodes until
    validation is impossible for most users and we degrade to a trusted system. That's why having a conservative hard

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">State bloat is
    the problem of storing the ever-growing data produced by blockchains with growth in their transactions, accounts,
    tokens, contracts, and other information. To accurately arrive at the current state in a trustless manner, every
    full blockchain node must store the history of every address used, every token traded, every NFT minted, and any
    other transactions from the genesis block.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">While older
    blockchains have bloated states due to their long histories, the newer blockchains face these problems due to their
    high throughput. For example, Ethereum's most popular client, Geth, has a state size of ~600 GB, with about 11 GB
    added every week. While it can still theoretically run on consumer-grade hardware, as the state size keeps
    increasing, it may not be possible in the future. Ethereum plans to address the problem of state size in a later set
    of upgrades called “<a href="https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1466411377107558402?s=20" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">The Purge</a>". On the other hand, Solana, as a high-performance blockchain, creates data at
    the rate of 1 GB per second or 4 PB per year. It had initially planned to use a set of "<a

      target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">Archivers</a>" to maintain the historical record of transactions while nodes
    would only store data for the last few days. Later, it scrapped this project with plans to use <a

      class="jss73 jss75">Arweave’s</a> permaweb to store ledger data. However, Arweave currently only holds 52 TB of
    data, so it would need to scale significantly to address the demand from Solana. Solana now has no decentralized
    solution to store transaction history and uses <a
      href="https://docs.solana.com/implemented-proposals/rpc-transaction-history" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">Google’s Big Table</a> as a storage solution in the meantime.</p>

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina stays a

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Zero-knowledge
    proofs are a way to prove something with the verifier learning no information other than the statement is true. It
    is easier to understand through an example. Imagine you are on a game show where there is a prize hidden behind one
    of the thousand doors in front of you. To find the prize, your best strategy would be to open the doors in sequence.
    If you then wanted to prove to someone that you knew where the prize was, you could tell them the door number, and
    they could verify it themselves. This would be simple proof that you have the answer, but it crucially shares the
    solution with the verifier. However, if you blindfolded them and spun them around before taking them to the door
    with the prize, you could still prove that you knew where the prize was without sharing the door number. This would
    be a zero-knowledge proof. It confirms that you, the prover, know the solution without leaking it to the verifier.
    It’s worth noting that there is also an asymmetry of work. The amount of work done by the prover to find the answer
    is much more than that done by the verifier to check if it is correct. The prover has to search through each door
    till they find the correct one, whereas the verifier only needs to check one door.</p>

    Knowledge (SNARK)</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">SNARKs are a
    type of zero-knowledge proof. They are called <strong>succinct</strong> because they are small and easy to verify. A
    SNARK proof is ~7 kB on Mina and verifying it only requires 200ms.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">While some zk
    proofs can require a back-and-forth exchange of information between the prover and verifier,
    <strong>non-interactive</strong> proofs can be authenticated by the verifier without more interaction with the
    prover.
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Arguments</strong> are a formalism for proofs. In cryptography, proofs can only be generated of valid
    statements, while invalid argument proofs may be generated by using exorbitant computational power. However, that is
    only a theoretical difference, and for our purposes, we can consider arguments to be the same as proofs.
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Knowledge</strong> refers to the fact that the prover has the answer. In our example, they do not just prove
    there is a prize, but they also that they know which door it's behind.
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Therefore,
    SNARKs are small, easy-to-verify proofs of knowledge that do not need back-and-forth communication between the

    uses a type of zk-SNARK called Pickles that can <strong>recursively</strong> refer to itself, thus creating proofs
    of proofs and keeping the blockchain a fixed size. An additional property of Pickles is that, unlike other SNARKs,

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">With the help
    of zk-SNARKs, Mina can have a version of the blockchain that remains a small and fixed size. Whenever a new block is
    added, a new zk-SNARK carrying the previous block’s zk-SNARK must be created to prove it is valid. This SNARK can
    only be created if the block’s data is correct. Therefore, a SNARK proves that the current block is valid and
    references the previous block’s SNARK that proved that it was valid. In this way, the entire state of blockchain can
    be confirmed just by verifying the current SNARK because it must have been generated on top of a series of valid
    SNARKs from genesis.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">However, a
    cryptographic proof is not enough to run a full node. The proof alone does not allow the node to perform its
    essential functions because it does not supply clear information, such as the account balance. In addition, a node
    needs four more pieces of information to function. The first is the protocol state containing hashed data
    structures, including the ledger. The second is a verification key for the SNARK proof and the protocol state. Next,
    a node must also store account information and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">Merkle</a> path that matches the protocol's to trustlessly ensure the account information is
    correct and pertains to the current protocol state.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">While the Mina
    marketing material claims the blockchain is ~22 kB, with improvements in technology, it will just be ~11 kB.</p>

    kB, really?</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Well, not
    entirely and not right now. Since such a node does not have the complete history of transactions, it cannot
    participate in consensus and is thus called a non-consensus node. However, it is much more powerful than a light
    node of a traditional blockchain as it operates without trust assumptions. It can independently verify the
    blockchain data, pull its account balance, and broadcast transactions. In this respect, it is similar to a full
    non-mining node on Bitcoin or Ethereum. Another thing to note is that non-consensus nodes are currently not live;
    they are being developed by the teams support Mina Protocol.</p><img

    from state bloat and may require powerful industrial-grade hardware to run full nodes, Mina's non-consensus nodes
    will run on smartphones or browsers. Every user would be able to run their own node, significantly improving
    decentralization. The blockchain ideal beyond self-custody is self-verification, and Mina is the only blockchain
    that will enable it.</p><img

    Asymmetry of work</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">For
    traditional blockchains, every node must execute every transaction independently, leading to wasted computing
    resources and higher transaction costs. Verifying a transaction's zero-knowledge proof is much less
    resource-intensive than executing the transaction itself. This is the premise of zk-rollups on Ethereum, which
    Buterin considers the most crucial piece in the journey to scale Ethereum. Mina, however, has zero-knowledge proofs
    baked into its protocol design.</p>
  <h3 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss68 MuiTypography-h3 css-qubbtm e1de0imv0" id="c17fd83a5689-privacy">Privacy
  </h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Zero-knowledge
    proofs support privacy by not leaking any unnecessary information. A zk-proof of the Mina blockchain only proves
    that the state is valid without showing the interacting accounts. Even Mina’s consensus nodes only keep a history of
    the last 290 blocks.</p>
  <h2 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss67 MuiTypography-h2 css-1tq4az3 e1de0imv0" id="fdcb5bd5c835-consensus">
    Consensus</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina uses a
    consensus mechanism called Ouroboros Samasika, a modified version of Cardano's consensus mechanism, Ouroboros.
    Ouroboros Samasika has the added property of working with a succinct blockchain that does not keep an entire history
    of transactions. Like other proof-of-stake chains, the probability of being selected as a block producer depends on
    the amount of Mina staked by a node relative to the total stake. Like Cardano, Mina does not require nodes to lock
    funds, nor does the network slash funds. The network stops distributing rewards to nodes that go offline or engage
    in bad behavior.</p><img
    src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/67c583524641379ddbf4cc85eab3e5010993537a-1280x720.png?w=800&amp;auto=format"
    alt="" role="button" title="View full size" class="jss76">
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The network
    does not know nor announce the next block producer, and multiple block producers may qualify. This ambiguity adds to
    the protocol's security by creating a natural defense against denial-of-service attacks against block producers.
    However, it has the disadvantage of sometimes creating short-term forks. If multiple block producers produce
    different valid blocks, the next block producer follows standard consensus rules and builds on top of the longest
    chain. If only same-length chains are available, block producers build on top of the first-seen chain or replace it
    if another one has a higher verifiable random function output.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">This design
    choice also means that Mina has probabilistic finality. With a 90% honest stake and 4-minute block time, Mina
    reaches 99.9% finality in 15 blocks, i.e., 60 mins. This is much longer than some other new blockchains like Solana
    and Avalanche that take seconds to finalize transactions.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">There are two
    important players in the transaction execution process for Mina: block producers and SNARKers. Block producers are
    similar to validators of other proof-of-stake chains. They are randomly selected to produce a block based on the
    percentage of their stake compared to the total stake. SNARKers or SNARK workers produce the SNARK proofs of
    individual transactions of the blockchain. To better understand their roles, let's look at the transaction life
    cycle on Mina.</p>
  <ol class="jss79">
    <li class="jss71">First, to execute a transaction, users broadcast it to the network with the information of the fee
      they are willing to pay, which gets collected in the transaction mempool.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Independently, SNARKers continuously work on supplying SNARK proofs of these transactions so that
      they can be included in the block.</li>
    <li class="jss71">As a block producer is selected, they queue the most profitable transactions with the highest fee
      from the transactions available in the mempool. Block producers, however, must also add SNARK proofs of an equal
      number of transactions as they are adding to the queue. They can either produce the SNARK proofs themselves or buy
      the SNARK proofs from the SNARKers.</li>
    <li class="jss71">SNARKers compete amongst themselves to supply the SNARK proof at the lowest cost. As per Mina
      Explorer, over the last 100 blocks, all SNARK proofs were provided for free by the SNARKers. SNARKers may later be
      subsidized by protocol incentives similar to mining, called SNARK mining.</li>
    <li class="jss71">The block producer then updates the queue, which keeps a constant size as the number of new
      unSNARKed transactions equals the number of transactions deleted after being SNARKed.</li>
    <li class="jss71">The block producer then includes the SNARKed transactions in the block and updates the zk-SNARK
      proof of the protocol state.</li>
    <li class="jss71">The new block and SNARK proof are gossiped across the network and confirmed by the other nodes.

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina uses a
    fee market and is similar to Bitcoin in that each transaction waits in the mempool till block producers add it.
    Usually, a user can ensure that block producers add their transactions to the blockchain by paying a high-enough fee
    or waiting long enough.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">For a
    transaction to be censored, either all SNARKers would have to refuse to produce the SNARK proof, or all block
    producers would have to refuse to add the SNARKed transaction to a block. Under Ouroboros, we can presume that the
    network is decentralized, and the block producers are not colluding.</p>

    amongst all the SNARKers is extremely hard. First, there is no barrier of entry for anyone to SNARK a transaction.
    Because the cost of SNARKing is tiny, anyone can produce a SNARK proof of a transaction and earn the SNARKing fee.
    Even with a low transaction fee, a block producer should profitably be able to include a SNARKed transaction in a
    block.</p>

    Network Stats</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina is a
    relatively new blockchain with unique architecture. As such, only a limited amount of data is available with respect
    to the network and its adoption. We have compiled the following information from the currently available explorers
    and dashboards.</p><img
    src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/32870795e4e782637f851ad81c7dc13fc1b1b24b-1280x720.png?w=800&amp;auto=format"

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina's
    theoretical throughput is one transaction per second. Clearly, Mina does not compete with other newer blockchains on
    throughput volume. Instead of just comparing blockchains on their throughput numbers, Mina tries to compete on a
    more holistic metric of <a href="https://minaprotocol.com/blog/solving-the-scalability-trilemma" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">scale per unit of decentralization</a> or ScaDe. The ScaDe frontier is a corollary of the
    blockchain trilemma that suggests that the amount of throughput of a blockchain is inversely proportional to the
    number of full nodes. Because Mina aims to maximize decentralization with no theoretical limit on the number of
    nodes, it operates outside the ScaDe frontier.</p>
  <h2 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss67 MuiTypography-h2 css-1tq4az3 e1de0imv0" id="4ac96952d430-the-mina-token">The
    MINA Token</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">As the
    blockchain’s native token, MINA is used to pay transaction fees and incentivizes consensus participation through
    block rewards. Currently, the <a href="https://github.com/MinaProtocol/MIPs" target="_blank"
      class="jss73 jss75">governance process</a> does not have token-based voting, whether on-chain or on the forum,
    although there are plans for it.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">MINA is an
    inflationary currency with initial inflation of 12% that will reduce to settle at 7% after four years from mainnet
    launch. Inflation is fixed, and staking yields change with the staking participation rate. While inflation may seem
    high, it helps to keep the chain secure as it encourages staking participation.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">There are
    multiple ways to look at the supply of MINA, such as a circulating supply that excludes time-locked tokens or a
    fully diluted supply that includes them. The simplest and most accurate way is through staking supply. MINA had an
    initial total supply of one billion tokens, of which 806 million were available for staking at launch. Most of these
    tokens were locked for selling but were available for staking, thus earned block rewards. The remaining 194 million
    tokens of the initial supply are being distributed to the community over time in the form of supercharged rewards,
    SNARK mining rewards, and ecosystem grants.</p><img

    Mina are some of the most well-known crypto venture funds like FTX Ventures, Three Arrows Capital, Paradigm,
    Coinbase Ventures, Polychain Capital, Electric Capital, and Multicoin Capital. The community sale also saw

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Recently,
    there was a debacle with Looks Rare and its staking rewards. Similar to Mina, insiders held locked tokens that were
    not a part of the circulating supply but could be staked to earn rewards. This allowed them to earn a significant
    proportion of staking rewards in the initial days after launch as their holdings were much higher than the
    circulating supply. Notable Twitter personality, Cobie, covered this in his recent blog titled, "<a
      href="https://cobie.substack.com/p/incentives-structures?s=r" target="_blank" class="jss73 jss75">Incentives
      Structures</a>”.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina avoided
    this controversy before it took place by having a better-designed rewards structure. In the first 15 months after
    launch, users who stake unlocked tokens receive increased block rewards called supercharged rewards. Currently, the
    rewards earned by unlocked stakers double those of locked stakers, allowing for a more community-favored reward
    distribution and avoiding the controversy faced by the Looks Rare team.</p>

  </h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Mina has an
    exciting product, but the team is still building its most groundbreaking features. It currently only functions as a
    payment chain with a few hundred validators. Smart contract functionality, non-consensus nodes, and an oracle that
    can trustlessly pull data from the internet are promising features slated to be added in 2022. Mina also has plans
    to develop a zk-Rollup that stores data off-chain, which will enable it to scale its throughput.</p><img

    Conclusion</h2>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">While the
    world has primarily focused on platform wars and Ethereum's scaling solutions, Mina has been building a promising
    solution to capitalize on the potential in the zero-knowledge space without compromising on decentralization. With a
    strong team, impressive partners and backers, and a new war chest of funds, Mina can begin to execute on its
    ambitious roadmap. Mina's contributors can draw inspiration from what alternate platform chains like Solana,
    Avalanche, and Terra achieved in 2021. The winner has not yet been decided, and if Mina can build a strong product,
    users and investors will come.</p>
