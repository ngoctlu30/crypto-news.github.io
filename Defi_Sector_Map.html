    Insights</h3>
  <ul class="jss70">
    <li class="jss71">DEXs are the highest-grossing DeFi sector, accounting for nearly half of all DeFi revenue.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Despite having nearly 25% more TVL than DEXs, Lending protocols earn nearly a quarter of the
      revenue and thus return significantly less per unit of TVL.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Perpetual exchanges are emerging as users’ preferred leverage mechanism over money markets.
      Volumes on perpetual exchanges increased by 20% year-to-date while lending borrow volume decreased by nearly 50%.
    </li>
    <li class="jss71">Due to their capital structure, derivative protocols return 4–9 times more in revenue per unit of
      inventory (TVL) compared to the rest of DeFi sectors.</li>
    <li class="jss71">Liquid Staking Protocols (e.g., Lido) is the fastest-growing sector in terms of TVL, adding over
      50% in the last 90 days while DEXs and Lending both decreased by over 14%.</li>
  </ul>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">DeFi is
    crypto’s largest and longest-standing application vertical. Its market cap, excluding stablecoins, stands at roughly
    $70 billion which is 10% of Layer-1 tokens. Given DeFi’s foundational role within crypto, understanding the variety
    of sectors within DeFi and how they are changing provides valuable context for navigating crypto going forward.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The entirety
    of DeFi can be broken down into a variety of layers which can be further divided into specific sectors.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"><strong>Chain
      Layer</strong></p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">At the bottom
    of the DeFi ecosystem is the Chain Layer. Smart Contract protocols like Ethereum, Solana, and Avax provide the
    blockchain infrastructure that DeFi applications run on top of. Additionally, there are scaling solutions targeted
    at increasing the transaction throughput efficiency of these base Smart Contract protocols. Infrastructure tools
    round out this layer and provide DeFi apps with API access to the networks, data, and potentially even liquidity.
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"><strong>DeFi
      Primitive Layer</strong></p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The DeFi
    Primitive Layer lies in the middle and represents the bulk of today’s DeFi value. DEXs, Lending, Derivatives, and
    Stablecoins make up the core primitive categories of DeFi. Each represents a distinct type of DeFi protocol, which
    consequently produces unique revenue models and revenue efficiency. Revenue generated in this layer provides the
    primary source of organic yields in DeFi. Since these sectors form the foundation of DeFi, understanding their
    unique revenue models and efficiencies is the first step to grasping the entirety of DeFi.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Aggregation Layer</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">On top of DeFi
    Primitive protocols sits the Aggregation Layer. Aggregator protocols fall into two camps. Supply-side protocols
    aggregate capital into a single protocol and then disperse the capital to various protocols. A common example is a
    yield aggregator. Demand-side aggregators differ by aggregating user demand for a service such as DEX trades or
    credit. User demand is pooled together or routed amongst primitive service providers to provide execution
    efficiencies.</p>
  <h3 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss68 MuiTypography-h3 css-qubbtm e1de0imv0"
    id="2c045080466a-breaking-down-the-defi-primitive-sectors">Breaking Down the DeFi Primitive Sectors</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The amount of
    capital deposited into a sector can be used to measure importance within the DeFi ecosystem. By mapping out each
    sector according to its deposit share and revenue levels, it becomes clear which sectors are materially important
    and which are best at converting deposits into productive revenue. Since the Derivatives sector encompasses a
    variety of services, it's useful to break apart the sector into its main verticals: Liquid Staking, Synthetics,
    Perpetuals, and Options.</p><img

    alt="" role="button" title="View full size" class="jss73">
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>DEXs</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">So far
    speculation has been crypto’s primary use case. Consequently, DEXs have captured significant value by facilitating
    the very exchange of tokens that speculation requires. DEXs earn revenue through trade fees which range from 3 bps
    to 100 bps of the amount swapped. This fee revenue is the largest source of organic revenue in DeFi and amounts to
    nearly all other sector revenues combined.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">DEXs generate
    this revenue fairly efficiently as well. Liquidity providers (LPs) supply the capital to pools and expect to earn
    trading fees in return. Compared to lending protocols, DEXs have about a third less capital locked in the protocols
    yet generate nearly four times as much revenue. Unlike lending protocols, however, DEX LPs are subject to losses
    known as <a href="https://academy.binance.com/en/articles/impermanent-loss-explained" target="_blank"
      class="jss75 jss77">impermanent loss</a>.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">While DEX
    returns are relatively high, as with many protocols in DeFi, DEXs are prone to variable revenue profiles. When
    prices are going up, users are significantly more active (hence, speculation-driven). Revenues thus wax and wane as
    broader crypto markets go through various ups and downs. Currently, DEXs have been down in revenue terms over the
    last 90 days.</p><img

    alt="" role="button" title="View full size" class="jss73">
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Lending</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Lending
    protocols have nearly half of all the deposits in DeFi (44%). Deposits in lending protocols serve as the collateral
    for loans. Users are required to deposit more assets than they take out in loans. This creates an overcollateralized
    system that is safe but inefficient.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">If loans
    become too risky relative to a user’s collateral, the deposits are liquidated to pay down the debt. Although this
    dynamic keeps the whole system stable, lending protocols have poor revenue efficiency due to revenue only being
    generated on the loans which is of less value than the required deposits. To scale revenue as fast as other sectors
    like DEXs, lending protocols have to attract four times as much capital.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Historically,
    users accepted this drawback because lending protocols were the only on-chain source of leverage. But perpetual
    protocols are becoming more prevalent on-chain. The rolling 30d ratio of perpetual volumes to lending protocol’s
    outstanding loans has doubled since the start of the year and is now at an all-time-high. Moreover, the Lending
    sector has lost relative deposit share each of the last four 90d periods.</p><img

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Staking</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Liquid Staking
    protocols operate in conjunction with Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chains. Instead of staking tokens directly with a
    validator and thus losing the ability to use funds in DeFi, Liquid Staking protocols provide the best of both
    worlds. Users staking via these protocols earn the usual staking rewards but also receive a derivative token to be
    used elsewhere.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"><a
      class="jss75 jss77" href="/article/a-valuation-model-for-lido-dao">Lido</a> is the dominant player in this sector
    with nearly 90% market share. It earns revenue by taking a cut (usually 10%) of the staking rewards earned.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">With the
    upcoming Ethereum merge and the rapid rise of emerging PoS networks like Terra, Liquid Staking is the fastest
    growing sector in terms of TVL, up over 50% in the last 90 days.</p><img
    src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6eb7167d62a126be1b75091c12d0f64f5500952d-1600x900.png?w=800&amp;auto=format"
    alt="" role="button" title="View full size" class="jss73">
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0"><strong>Yield
      Aggregators</strong></p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">As the name
    implies, Yield Aggregators (such as <a class="jss75 jss77" href="/article/yearning-for-yearn">Yearn</a>) sit in the
    Aggregation Layer of DeFi. Users deposit funds into a single Yield protocol which subsequently deposits the funds
    into various primitive-layer protocols like DEXs, lending markets, and liquid staking. As a result, the generated
    yield ultimately becomes a function of the primitive layer’s revenues. However, higher returns are often delivered
    due to the token reward emissions of the primitive protocols.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">In addition to
    organic fee revenue, primitive protocols typically give rewards to users in the form of their governance token.
    Yield aggregators take advantage of this by immediately selling the reward tokens for more of the user’s token. Note
    that this is a compounding process since the size of the rewards are usually dictated by the amount deployed in the
    primitive protocol</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">This
    dependence on the primitive layer introduces a limited component to the growth of yield aggregator protocols.
    Revenue at the primitive layer is driven by demand for their services such as loans and trades. As such, yield
    aggregators can only grow effectively to the size of this demand. Additional capital supplied beyond the primitive
    services demand doesn’t earn yield.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Synthetics</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Not all assets
    live on-chain. It’d also be impractical to have every on-chain asset across every chain and protocol. Synthetic
    protocols solve this by taking in user deposits which are then used as collateral to mint synthetic assets. These
    synthetic assets can represent anything. As long as there is a reliable oracle price feed, any asset, whether it’s a
    stock or another chain’s token, can be minted.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The growing
    use case for Synthetic protocols is to power other protocols building on top of them. For example, Synthetix, the
    leading protocol in the sector, powers Kwenta, a protocol for trading perpetuals on Optimism. Kwenta sources its
    exchange liquidity from Synthetix which allows the exchange to trade unique assets at low slippage.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Synthetix in
    particular earns revenue from the swap fees of its synthetic assets. However, the fees are relatively small compared
    to other sectors as synthetics have lagged in broader adoption. Both the high collateral ratio required to mint
    synthetic assets and the difficulty of driving usage of said assets partially contribute to the slow adoption rates.
    The low adoption could be positioned to change in the coming months, however, as the partner protocols like Kwenta
    attract more users via proximity on L2s. Already signs are showing as Synthetics has been the fastest growing sector
    in revenue.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Perpetuals</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The most
    traded assets on CEXs are a derivative product called perpetuals. Perpetuals are highly traded because they look and
    feel like a normal token to traders (its price is the same), but its design doesn’t require either trader to
    actually hold and deliver the physical token. Without the constraint of physical token delivery, exchanges can offer
    leverage to traders. This leverage is wildly popular due to its multiplicative effect of increasing returns (and
    losses).</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Since Q3 2021,
    perpetuals have grown significantly on-chain. The on-chain protocols like dYdX, Perpetual Protocol, and others
    operate a simple exchange where traders can access these products permissionlessly. Similar to spot DEXs, these
    perpetual exchanges charge a per trade fee.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Unlike spot
    DEXs, perpetual exchanges charge a fee on the leveraged trade amount (notional volume). As a result, perpetual
    protocols experience a significantly higher return on assets (ROA) compared to not just spot DEXs but all of DeFi.
    Essentially, perpetual protocols earn nearly 10 times more revenue per unit of inventory (TVL) than DEXs and more
    than 40 times more than lending protocols.</p><img
    src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/47a70340b88021789756ddc6b326210ef54ed0a4-1600x900.png?w=800&amp;auto=format"

  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">
    <strong>Options</strong>
  </p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Options have
    had <a class="jss75 jss77" href="/article/overview-of-options-vaults">a slow start on-chain</a>. Despite options
    being Robinhood’s top grossing product, retail crypto traders have prefered other forms of leverage like perpetuals.
    However, there is a rising interest in decentralized options vaults (DOVs). DOVs take user deposits and use the
    funds to underwrite and subsequently sell the contracts to other parties. In exchange, the buyers pay a premium
    which is sent back to the DOV as yield for deposits.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">The generated
    yield serves as the revenue of the protocol. Options protocols offering DOVs typically take a cut of the yield
    generated and may also impose a fee on the total assets deposited.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">In terms of
    revenue efficiency, Options protocols are the second most efficient and generate about four times as much per unit
    of TVL. While this is significant on a percentage basis, it's important to recognize DOV Options protocols are the
    second lowest grossing sector mentioned in this report and can only scale revenues relative to the options buying
    demand.</p>
  <h3 class="jss66 MuiTypography-root jss68 MuiTypography-h3 css-qubbtm e1de0imv0" id="afa5ef93188f-looking-ahead">
    Looking Ahead</h3>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Understanding
    DeFi’s sectors and the current dynamics is key to navigating its future as L2s, multi-chain, and modularity begin to
    reshape the architecture. As it stands, DEXs continue to dominate the DeFi space and likely will continue to. Not
    only do they account for nearly half of the DeFi revenue, they are attracting an increasing portion of the capital
    locked in DeFi.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">Looking across
    sectors, the biggest shift occurring is the rising popularity of perpetual protocols eating into the Lending
    sector’s market share. The rolling 30d perpetual volumes ratio to total lending debt will provide an indication if
    the trend is to continue.</p>
  <p class="MuiTypography-root MuiTypography-inherit MuiTypography-paragraph jss72 css-1ou2v44 e1de0imv0">More broadly,
    the current sectors and liquidity architecture defined here were constructed on a single, monolithic chain (e.g.,
    Ethereum). However, as a multichain future becomes more prevalent, the liquidity architecture of the DeFi sectors
    could see small but impactful shifts. For example, Aave V3 has a new feature which enables it to supply just-in-time
    liquidity to bridge users hopping between chains. This is just one example of many to keep an eye on going forward.
